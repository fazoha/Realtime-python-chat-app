# Realtime-python-chat-app
Simple python application which allows users to send and receive messages in real time.
Purpose: Developed a chat application facilitating communication between a sender and a receiver over a local network.

Key Features:

Direct Communication: Designed a server-client model using sockets to establish a connection and enable real-time chat.
Concurrent Operations: Leveraged multi-threading to manage simultaneous send and receive tasks, ensuring a responsive user interface.
User-Friendly Interface: Crafted an intuitive GUI using Tkinter, offering seamless options to initiate server listening, send messages, and view chat history.
Technologies Used: Python, Sockets, Threading, Tkinter.

Challenges & Learning: Tackled challenges in ensuring proper connection setup between sender and receiver. This project deepened my understanding of network programming, multi-threading, and GUI creation in Python.
